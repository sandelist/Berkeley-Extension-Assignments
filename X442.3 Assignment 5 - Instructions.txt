Written Assignment Module 5 - Instructions

Control Structures

Coding assignments can be saved as .py files when appropriate or .txt files otherwise, for example, you may want to past the code from multiple .py files into a single .txt file. When you've completed the assignment, attach the file(s) to the drop box for this module, which you'll find near the end of the module. Please be sure to include your last name and the course number in the file name of the document, like so: "your name X442.3 Assignment 5."

    Using the keys method for dictionaries and the sort method for lists, write a for loop that prints the keys and corresponding values of a dictionary in the alphabetical order of the keys.
    As an alternative to the range function, some programmers like to increment a counter inside a while loop and stop the while loop when the counter is no longer less than the length of the array. Rewrite the following code using a while loop instead of a for loop.

a = [7,12,9,14,15,18,12] 
b = [9,14,8,3,15,17,15] 
big = [ ] 
for i in range ( len ( a ) ): 
    big.append ( max ( a [ i ],b [ i ] ) ) 

    Write a loop that reads each line of a file. It should count the number of characters in each line and keep track of the total number of characters read. Once you have a total of 1,000 or more characters, break from the loop. (You can use a break statement to do this.)
    Modify the program written in question 3 so that it doesn't count characters on any line that begins with a pound sign (#).
