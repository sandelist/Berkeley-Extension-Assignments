1. Write a simple Rectangle class. It should do the following:

        Accepts length and width as parameters when creating a new instance
        Has a perimeter method that returns the perimeter of the rectangle
        Has an area method that returns the area of the rectangle
        Don't worry about coordinates or negative values, etc.

Python provides several modules to allow you to easily extend some of the basic objects in the language. Among these modules are UserDict, UserList, and UserString. (Refer to the chart in Topic 10.3 to see what the methods you need to override look like. Also, since UserDict and UserList are part of the collection module, you can import them using from collections import UserDict and from collections import UserList.)

2. Using the UserList module, create a class called Ulist, and override the __add__, append, and extend methods so that duplicate values will not be added to the list by any of these operations.

3. (Extra Credit) Using the UserDict module, create a class called AnyCaseDict, which will be just like a dictionary but keys that are strings will refer to the same value, regardless of the case of the key. For example, the following keys: "Color", "color", "COLOR" and "coloR" will refer to the same value.
(Hint: Override the built-in __setitem__ and __getitem__ methods.)
